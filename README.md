## Portable Terraria
Portable Terraria to use on a USB device.

Simply extract the zip file on your USB device and open "TERRARIA.lnk", this will bring you to a folder where you can:

1.save your progress on your USB (save);

2.load your saved progress from your USB to the computer (load save);

3.start terraria (terraria).

the save and load scripts are needed because terraria saves your progress on the computer instead of the USB, these scripts help you transfer the progress from the USB to the pc and viceversa just in one click.

##NOTE

this is supposed to work with the USB drive letter being E , if you don't have it already set on E it will most probably not work, to change it go to the partition manager, right click on your USB device and click "change drive letter". then simply set it to E .
