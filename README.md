# Portable Terraria
Portable Terraria to use on a USB device.

Simply extract the zip file on your USB device and open "TERRARIA.lnk", this will bring you to a folder where you can:
1.save your progress on your USB (save);
2.load your saved progress from your USB to the computer (load save);
3.start terraria (terraria).

the save and load scripts are needed because terraria saves your progress on the computer instead of the USB, these scripts help you transfer the progress from the USB to the pc and viceversa just in one click.
